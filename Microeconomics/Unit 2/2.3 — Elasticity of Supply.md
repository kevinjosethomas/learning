Elasticity of supply shows how sensitive **producers** are to a change in price. Elasticity of supply is based on time limitations. Essentially, producers need time to produce more.
$$
\frac{\% \Delta \text{ quantity}}{\% \Delta \text{ price}}
$$

**Elastic supply** is sensitive to a change in price (flat curve). Most goods have elastic supply in the long-run

**Inelastic supply** is insensitive to a change in price (steep curve). Most goods have inelastic supply in the short-run

**Perfectly inelastic** is when the Q doesn't change (vertical line)
