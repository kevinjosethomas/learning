CLIP is a multimodal model developed by OpenAI which combines images and text to learn a shared representation of visual and textual information. It is widely used for zero-shot captioning of images.

CLIP was trained using a contrastive learning approach, where it was trained on image-text pairs from the internet. This allowed it to learn which caption matches with which image by optimizing for similarity between correct image-text pairs and pushing apart incorrect pairs.

It has two parts: an image encoder (like [[ResNet]] or a [[Vision Transformer]]) and a text encoder (typically a Transformer). Each encoder transforms its input into a feature vector, which represents the image or text in a high-dimensional space. The model then measures the similarity between these vectors to determine how well they match.

Even without fine-tuning, CLIP is often used for image classification, image search, and image generation guidance. For example, models like [[DALL-E]] use CLIP to guide their own image generation. CLIP also features a strong zero-shot learning ability, where it can generalize to new tasks without needing specific task-based training data.

An interesting interpretability finding from OpenAI was the idea of [Multimodal Neurons](https://openai.com/index/multimodal-neurons/), where they found that certain concepts were stored in single neurons in the model. For example, the same neuron would light up for photos of a spider, photos of spiderman, and photos of text writing spider. This suggests that CLIP semantically understands its inputs, and that a single neuron might be responsible for this phenomenon as well. However, recent [[Polysemanticity]] research shows that models might be far more complicated than this.
