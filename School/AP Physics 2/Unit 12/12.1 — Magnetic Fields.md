**Magnetic fields** are vector fields that describe the magnetic force exerted on moving charges, electric currents, or magnetic materials. They are created by **magnetic dipoles** or combinations of dipoles. A magnetic dipole has both north and south polarity.

Magnetic field lines allow us to visualize the magnetic field around a magnetic dipole/object. They point from the north pole to the south pole, and will always form a closed loop through a dipole. While magnetic field lines point from **north** to **south** outside the magnet, they point from **south** to **north** inside the magnet.

Magnetic dipoles are created by the rotational and circular motion of electric charge carriers (electrons?). When electrics spin (up or down), they create a magnetic field.
