Income elasticity shows how sensitive a product is to a change in income. Essentially, it shows if a good is normal or inferior.

$$
\frac{\% \Delta \text{ Quantity}}{\% \Delta \text{ Income}}
$$
If the coefficient is negative, then the good is inferior. If the coefficient is positive, then the good is normal. For example, if the income increases by 20% and the quantity decreases 15%, then the good is an **inferior good**.
