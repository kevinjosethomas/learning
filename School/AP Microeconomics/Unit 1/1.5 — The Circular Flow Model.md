## The Circular Flow Model
#### The Product Market
- The place where goods and services produced by businesses are sold to households
- Businesses sell goods and services to individuals through the product market
#### The Resource (Factor) Market
- The place where resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship) are sold to businesses
- In capitalism, individuals own the resources: labour, land, capital, and entrepreneurship
- Individuals provide resources for business through the resource market.
