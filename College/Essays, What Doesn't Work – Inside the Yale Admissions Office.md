- Many individual choices can be made well
	- Tells AOs what the student can add to the community, and gives a clear idea of who the person is
- Otherwise,
	- Ineffective essays that are essentially missed opportunities
	- From the application, it is clear that the student is dynamic and intelligent but the 650 words don't help AOs get to know the person better
		- "They came and they went"

### What not to do
- The most common issue is when AOs finish reading the essays and then think "So what?"
- Essays written in the third person
	- A few paragraphs in, there's a twist where "that person was actually me"
	- Students do this because they want storytelling, but it is always obvious that it is you
		- AOs scan for when this twist happens
- Drama for the sake of drama
	- Ties in to previous err
	- Feeling like you need to dramatize your story, or need a tragic story to stand out to AOs
	- Overdramatizing essays can get in the way of a simple genuine story about yourself
-  Only storytelling essay
	- An essay that is only storytelling
		- Nice beginning, middle, and end
	- This often leads to overdramatizing
	- Uses more words to tell a story rather than to reflect
- Stuck in the past essay
	- if an essay is written about an experience when you're 5, a lot has changed since then
		- Using it as a starting point to show growth might be good
		- Typically they get stuck in the past and then AOs ask "What about now?"
- Cover letter essay
	- Takes your activities list, and writes a cover letter essay 
	- Misses the opportunity to tell something new
	- Not using the space wisely, you already have space to talk about your activites
	- You can choose an activity to reflect on, but dont turn it into activity brag
- Death of a grandparent
	- Often unsuccessful – very predictable
	- You should have reflections and insights rather than just talking about your grandparents and your sadness
		- Compress all of that to the first third and talk more about yourself and your reflection
	- Don't give people a biography, its completely unnecessary
		- When speaking about a relationship, reflect it back to you – don't write a biography
- Don't go for the shock factor
	- Don't try to shock your AOs
- "Unlike most people..." essay
	- Suggest exceptionalism 
	- Don't define yourself in opposition to other people
- Writing a letter to someone else
	- Letter to future self or roommate
	- Too gimmicky
	- A huge amount of content is devoted to propping up the gimmick (salutation, turns of phrase, etc)
- Story of failure without redemption
	- Don't spend the entire essay talking about the failure, talk about redemption
	- An experience where you're not at your best can be a great essay, shows vulnerability
		- Ensure you make space for reflection
- Over-thesaurus essay
	- Don't write an essay with a thesaurus on your side
	- Use natural language
	- You want to sound smart, but make sure you sound **authentic**
	- Go for conversational tone instead
